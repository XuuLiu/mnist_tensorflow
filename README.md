# mnist_tensorflow
Use tensorflow functions to deal with mnist data 
1. Try Softmax, got Epoch: 
    045/050 cost: 0.316073865 train_acc: 0.852 test_acc: 0.917
2. Try a simple neural network(with 2 hidden layers):
    Epoch:047/050 cost: 0.286422827 train accuracy: 0.867 test accuracy: 0.923
3. Try a simple CNN (with 2 conv, 2 pooling and 2 full connection layers):
    Epoch:045/050 cost:0.079185180 training accuracy: 0.953 test accuracy: 0.971
